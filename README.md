# Instagram Video Report Automation Script

A basic Chrome extension that automatically reports videos longer than 60 seconds on Instagram for inappropriate content, to be used by Hitmen.
I will most likely be working on this more in the future, but PLEASE if you need it, contribute!

## What it does

- Automatically reports videos over 60 seconds
- Uses randomized delays to seem more human-like
- Runs in the background while browsing

## ⚠️ Important Warning

This is a very basic proof-of-concept script with serious risks:

- Will blindly report ALL long videos (could get your account banned)
- No verification of actual inappropriate content
- Might be detected as automated behavior
- Will randomly click the wrong button (but should never *submit* a false report, just *start* it (you have to press back manually))
